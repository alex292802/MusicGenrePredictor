# Music Genre Predictor
A program that predict the genre of a music based on its carateristics fetched from the spotify API.

In this part we use the files Spotify_dataset_train.csv and Spotify_dataset_test.csv.
The csv file, for training, contains a dataset of 25492 songs belonging to one of those 23 musical genres :
[r&b, rap, classical, salsa, edm, hip hop, trap, techno, jazz, metal, country, rock, reggae, latin, disco, soul, chanson, blues, dance, electro, punk, folk, pop].

After using classifiers such as Random Forest, LDA, QDA, naive Bayes or SVM predict the musical genre of the 2833 songs of test dataset, we decided to use a neural network.
To launch this neural network, you need to execute the file main.py.

## The prediction will only be based on the metadata provided by the spotify API, not the audio data
